Our crews checked the sanitary sewer mains in the area and found that they were working properly.    They checked the upstream storm drain inlet and found that it was clear.  They proceed by doing a confine space entry and one of the employees walked up the box culvert and at approximately 100 feet found a cast iron private lateral that was abandoned and the end of it had fallen into the box culvert while the other end was still connected to a live private lateral.  The employee proceeded by disconnecting the portion of the pipe that was abandoned and plug the end that was connected to the live private lateral to prevent further overflows from the connection.,,,Upper Lateral, ,4,cast iron, ,Contained all or portion of spill,"Our crews contained the spill in the box culvert upon arrival at Hatch lane and Burlingame Avenue and California.

Then one of the employees washed down the box culvert vacuuming all the water at both locations.  We estimated using 2,000 gallons of water to wash down the spill which they were able to vacuum the water and the spill from the two locations with the aid of the Vac-Cons.

The original caller  Mehdi  was contacted and he said the overflow occurred when he called at 2:07 PM.   The flow was intermittent but very light. Given the fact that it took at least 53 minutes (2:07 PM to 3:00 PM) to overflow 11 gallons in the parking lot, the estimate of 5 gallons lost seems accurate since it would take time for the flow to reach the catch basin inlet.

Robert Koczko, CVWD Sewer Maintenance Foreman, received a call of a sewer backup 9685 Northampton Street at approximately 9:00pm. Call came directly to Koczko from Al Otine District Stand-by person. Koczko immediately responded to the District yard while Al called Shawn Spromberg and Gabe Parisi to respond in Vactors 271 and 234 to the location.  Koczko and Spromberg  arrived on site by 9:15 pm to contain and control the situation.  Al was able to find the downstream manhole to set up  Vactor 271 (Parisi) to clear the blockage, while Koczko and Spromberg set up  Vactor 234  in the complex to contain and Vacuum the spill. This system is a private 8-inch sewer with a private Backwater Valve before it enters our public system.  The problem was the back water valve which was stuck obstructing the upstream flow, creating the blockage.  Al Otine and Parisi jetted to backwater valve hitting the flapper approximately 10 times before flow was restored which was approximately 9:30pm.     Vactor 234, (Koczko) was set up in the condo comlplex with the curb and gutter diked with dirt to contain the spill.  Vactor 234 Vacuum tube was set up in the private gutter catch basin to contain and collect spill.  We continued to flush the affected curb and gutter area and collected it at the containment area.  Approximately 500 gallons was spilled, collected and returned to the sewer collection system along with wash down water.  Clean up procedures lasted until 10:00 pm, with the crews in the yard by 10:30pm    The crew continued to inspect the private upstream and downstream sewer manholes to confirm flow was restored. We found that 2 m.h upstream there was a construction debris trap lodged in the line.  Koczko spoke to the management company CMS-Mike, of this private community.  Koczko explained that a plumber would need to be contacted to inspect their back water valve, and possibly clean and inspect their sewer collection system.  On Tuesday, April 24, 2012, District crews cctv the line and found that the backwater valve was off its hinge and needed replacement.  I informed Mike from CMS and the Backwater valve was replaced on Thursday, April 26, 2012.

The spill occurred in a private sewer system in a parking lot located at the City of Rancho Recreation facility.  Koczko called two Vactor crews to respond, with Koczko on site by 3:35pm.  Koczko saw a spill at less than 5GPM from a 4-inch clean out in the private parking lot and immediately set up a containment area at a storm drain inlet by way of dirt dam.  Vactor 271 showed up 5 minutes later and was set up at containment area to vacuum up spill and to control.  Since wastewater made it in the private storm drain system, all efforts were made to contain it.  Vactor 173 arrived on site by 3:45pm and set up to contain/vacuum the spill in the storm drain system, approximately 1200-feet downstream, at Foothill and Lion. Mike Moore, City of Rancho Cucamonga Environmental Programs Inspector, was on site and made the initial call to CVWD.  Rancho Plumbing was on site working to clear the blockage in the private lateral.  Plumber did not clear the blockage until 5:45 pm, however the spill was contained and controlled by both vactor crews.  Directly upstream from the spill point was Zendejas Restaurant, which was where the spill flow was coming from.  Koczko asked them to stop using water until line was cleared at approximately 4:00pm.  Koczko also called Eric Johnson, CVWD Industrial Waste Inspector, to inspect the restaurant grease interceptor.  Cause of blockage was unknown.      An estimate of spill was at 5GPM for 60 minutes until contained.  Approximately 300 gallons made its way into the private storm drain with 200 gallons collected.  District staff flushed the storm drain system and collected all washdown water at the storm drain by Lion and Foothill, returning it to the collection system.      All affected areas in the parking lot were washed down and contained, collected and returned to the sewer collection system.

Since the spill reached the storm drain, all efforts where made to contain and collect from the storm drain.  Dave set up Vactor 271 in a storm drain manhole on Church at Kahai.

Koczko was on site by 3:45pm, identified the sewer system as a private system and inspected all manholes on site to see where the problem was.  The problem was identified as a failure in the private backwater valve which is located on private property west of Baker north of Arrow.  Koczko made every attempt to notify management company of the situation since this was a private system and not the Districts responsibility.  Since we had no response from the management compay, the District action and restored flow by Jet rodding the line from the District sewer to the private backwater valve.  The jet rodder is used to bump the flapper valve, get it to move, allowing the debris and wastewater to flow through it.  We retrieved PVC pipe, wood stakes, rocks, rags and grease which was a contributor to the blockage stuck behind the flapper valve.  Less than 100 gallons of waste water spilled onto the property.      Once the system was restored to normal flow, Koczko proceeded to inspect the upstream private sewer manholes.  The manholes upstream had channels full of grease  and debris, also found one manhole structure that had lumber in the channels obstructing the flow.",

Environmental Manager Nicole Greene and Environmental Compliance Inspector Tanya Honeycutt arrived onsite at 3:30pm and made contact with Rick Jansen and John Adams.  The employees were notified that the blockage is in the lateral, and that a plumber needed to be contacted immediately to resolve the issue.  Greene and Honeycutt requried all water usage on the property to be suspended until the later was cleared and flow restored.  Plumber Paul Jenkin from Paul Jenkin Plumbing arrived onsite at 6:20 pm and the blockage was removed at 6:44pm by rodding the line.
